# C-Workshop-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Neural-Network
This project involves developing a neural network in C++ for recognizing handwritten digits (0-9) using the theoretical foundations of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and practical implementation techniques in C++. The project emphasizes understanding classes, operator overloading, references, and the Rule of Three in C++.
